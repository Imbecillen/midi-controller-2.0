# midi-controller-2.0

Based on https://github.com/FuzzyWobble/TeensyMonster

# plans

Modify to work with a Teensy LC.
Fix led lights corresponding to button presses.
Toggle button sending midi at release. Choosable? 
Also to multiplex buttons and to show potentiometer value at an oled display.

Big thanks to the Swedish facebook group Arduinobubblan and the Arduino community forum for supporting and helping along the way.

# open source is key

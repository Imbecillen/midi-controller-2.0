// Based on https://github.com/FuzzyWobble/TeensyMonster

# plans

- Modify to work with a Teensy LC.

- Fix led lights corresponding to button presses.

- Toggle button sending midi at release. Choosable? 

- Also to multiplex buttons and to show potentiometer value as a graph bar at an 128x64px oled display.

# open source is key

Big thanks to the Swedish facebook group Arduinobubblan and the Arduino community forum for supporting and helping along the way.
